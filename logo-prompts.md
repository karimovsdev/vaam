## 🔶 Prompt 1 — "Negative Space Solar Mark" (Mənfi Fəza Günəş İşarəsi — 2026 Minimal Trend)

```
Design an ultra-modern, trend-forward corporate logo for "VAAM" — a solar panel manufacturing and import-export trading company based in Baku, Azerbaijan. The design must reflect 2026 logo trends: negative space mastery, motion-ready design, dark-mode-first approach, and responsive logo system thinking.

CONCEPT — NEGATIVE SPACE SOLAR MARK:
The wordmark "VAAM" is constructed so that the NEGATIVE SPACE between and within the letters forms a hidden solar panel grid. When you look at the letters, you read "VAAM." When you look at the spaces between the letters, you see a 2×3 grid of solar photovoltaic cells. This dual-perception optical illusion is the core of the design — it rewards closer inspection and creates a memorable "aha moment."

LETTERFORM CONSTRUCTION (2026 Variable Typography):
- The typeface is a custom-drawn variable-weight geometric sans-serif — NOT a standard font
- Each letter uses a slightly different stroke weight that creates optical balance: the "V" is lightest (suggesting openness/beginning), the two "A"s are medium weight (the core/foundation), and the "M" is heaviest (grounded ending) — this progressive weight creates a visual rhythm unique to 2026 variable typography trends
- The letters are tightly kerned with mathematically precise gaps — these gaps are the key to the negative space illusion
- Letter corners use a 2px radius — not fully sharp, not rounded — the 2026 "soft geometric" micro-trend
- The crossbars of both "A" letters are positioned at exactly 38.2% height (golden ratio) rather than the traditional 50%, giving them a contemporary, slightly top-heavy proportion that feels fresh and non-standard
- The "V" has asymmetric arms: the left arm is at 72° and the right at 68°, creating a barely perceptible dynamic tension — the letter feels like it's in motion even while static

THE HIDDEN SOLAR GRID (Negative Space Detail):
- Between V and A₁: one vertical channel of negative space
- Between A₁ and A₂: the widest gap, forming the central column of the solar grid
- Between A₂ and M: one vertical channel
- The A crossbars + the letter tops + the baseline create the horizontal divisions
- Result: 6 rectangular cells (2 columns × 3 rows) visible in the negative space
- Each "cell" has the exact 1:1.6 proportion of a real 156mm monocrystalline solar cell
- The negative space grid is NOT drawn or outlined — it emerges purely from the letter placement

ICON ELEMENT — THE SOLAR DOT:
- A single perfect circle sits above the wordmark, centered over the gap between the two A's
- Diameter: exactly equal to the cap height of the letters
- The circle contains an aurora mesh gradient: emerald (#10b981) → teal (#0d9488) → cyan (#06b6d4) → back to emerald — a smooth, flowing color transition that appears to slowly shift (referencing the 2026 aurora gradient trend)
- Inside the circle, a minimal solar cell cross-pattern (one vertical + one horizontal hairline at 0.5px) divides it into 4 quadrants — a barely-visible micro-detail
- The circle has a subtle 1px inner glow (white at 20% opacity) creating a modern glassmorphism depth effect
- This circle functions as the standalone favicon/app icon

ANIMATION-READY SPECIFICATION (Motion Logo — 2026 Trend):
- The logo is designed with animation states in mind:
  - State 1 (Loading): The solar dot circle pulses with a breathing glow animation (scale 1.0 → 1.05 → 1.0, opacity of glow 20% → 40% → 20%, 3-second loop)
  - State 2 (Reveal): Letters draw on from left to right with a staggered 100ms delay each, while the solar dot fades in last with a scale-up from 0.8
  - State 3 (Idle): The aurora gradient inside the circle rotates slowly (360° in 20 seconds) — the only moving element
  - State 4 (Hover/Interactive): On hover, the negative space grid cells illuminate one by one in sequence (top-left → top-right → mid-left → mid-right → bottom-left → bottom-right) with a soft emerald glow (#10b981 at 8% opacity fill)
- NOTE: The logo must look perfect as a static mark — animation is an enhancement layer, not a requirement

COLOR SYSTEM (Dark Mode First — 2026):
- PRIMARY presentation: dark background (#020617 — near-black navy) with white (#f8fafc) letterforms and aurora gradient circle
- SECONDARY: white background with dark navy (#0f172a) letterforms and same aurora gradient circle
- MONOTONE: all-white version for dark backgrounds, all-black (#0f172a) for light
- The aurora gradient in the circle remains in ALL versions — it is the signature color element
- NO flat single-color fills on the primary version — the gradient IS the brand

RESPONSIVE LOGO SYSTEM (4 Tiers):
- Tier 1 — FULL (desktop/print): Circle icon + VAAM wordmark + "IMPORT · EXPORT · TRADING" tagline
- Tier 2 — COMPACT (tablet/social): Circle icon + VAAM wordmark (no tagline)
- Tier 3 — MINIMAL (mobile header): VAAM wordmark only (no icon)
- Tier 4 — MICRO (favicon/app icon): Circle icon only, inside a rounded-square container (border-radius: 22%)
- Each tier is a deliberate design, not a crop — spacing and proportions adjust per tier

TAGLINE:
- "IMPORT · EXPORT · TRADING" — Inter variable font, weight 350 (between light and regular), letter-spacing 0.35em
- Color: muted cool gray (#94a3b8) on dark backgrounds, (#64748b) on light
- No separator line — 2026 trend favors clean stacking without dividers

COMPOSITION:
- Horizontal lockup: circle on left, wordmark centered-right, tagline below wordmark — 3.5:1 aspect ratio
- Vertical lockup: circle on top, wordmark below, tagline at bottom — 1:1.6 aspect ratio
- Grid system: 4px base unit (all spacing is multiples of 4px)
- Minimum clear space around logo: 1× the height of the wordmark on all sides

RENDERING & PRESENTATION:
- Present the logo on a rich dark gradient background: linear-gradient(135deg, #020617 0%, #0f172a 50%, #1e293b 100%) — NOT plain black
- Show the logo with a subtle ambient light effect — a very soft, large emerald glow (#10b981 at 3% opacity, 200px blur) behind the circle, as if the logo emits energy
- Show all 4 responsive tiers in a horizontal row below the main presentation
- Show a dark-mode mobile app splash screen mockup with the logo centered
- Show the logo on a matte black business card with spot UV on the circle element
- 2026 design aesthetic: clean, sophisticated, tech-forward, premium, minimal
- 4K resolution, vector-perfect, no artifacts

## 🔶 Prompt 2 — "Kinetic Monoline" (Kinetik Tək Xətt — 2026 Motion-First Trend)

```
Design a cutting-edge, animation-native corporate logo for "VAAM" — a solar energy trading and manufacturing company specializing in photovoltaic panels, based in Baku, Azerbaijan. This logo must embody 2026's "motion-first" design philosophy — conceived as a moving identity that also works perfectly when frozen as a static frame.

CONCEPT — KINETIC MONOLINE:
A single continuous line of uniform 3px weight draws all four letters V-A-A-M in one unbroken stroke. But unlike traditional monoline logos, this one is designed as a KINETIC IDENTITY — the line has a visible energy particle (a glowing dot) that perpetually travels along the path, like electricity flowing through a circuit or solar energy moving through a transmission line.

MONOLINE PATH CONSTRUCTION (precise geometric description):
1. PATH START: A small energy dot (the "photon") appears at the top-left. The line begins moving downward-right at 65° to form the left stroke of "V"
2. "V" VERTEX: At the bottom, the line makes a smooth 130° turn (with a 4px radius curve — NOT a sharp corner, following 2026's "soft geometry" trend) and ascends right
3. V→A TRANSITION: The ascending right stroke of "V" continues without stopping directly into the left leg of the first "A" — the transition is seamless
4. FIRST "A" PEAK: The line reaches the apex and curves over (4px radius) to descend, forming the right leg
5. "A" CROSSBAR: Mid-descent, the line makes a horizontal detour to the left creating the crossbar, then reverses direction and continues right — this creates a subtle "zigzag" that reads as the crossbar while maintaining the single-line rule
6. A→A BRIDGE: The right leg of A₁ connects directly to the left leg of A₂ at the baseline — here the line runs horizontally for a brief moment, creating a visual "energy bridge" between the twin letters
7. SECOND "A": Mirrors the first but its peak is exactly 6% taller (barely perceptible), symbolizing growth. Same crossbar zigzag technique
8. A→M TRANSITION: Seamless flow into the "M" via baseline
9. "M" CONSTRUCTION: The line ascends to the first peak, descends to the valley (with a smooth 4px curve at the bottom), ascends to the second peak, and descends to the baseline
10. PATH END: The line terminates with a 6px diameter dot (matching the starting photon dot) — the circuit is complete

THE ENERGY PHOTON (Signature Animation Element):
- A luminous dot (6px diameter) with a warm golden core (#fbbf24) and a soft radial glow (16px, #f59e0b at 30% opacity)
- In the ANIMATED version: this dot travels along the entire monoline path continuously, taking 4 seconds for one complete journey, with an ease-in-out-cubic timing function
- As the photon moves, it leaves a brief "energy trail" — the 40px of line behind it temporarily brightens from the base color to white before fading back (like a comet tail)
- In the STATIC version: the photon is frozen at the exact center of the path (between the two A peaks), shown with its glow trail extending 40px in both directions along the line
- The photon symbolizes: a packet of solar energy (photon), the spark of trade/commerce, and continuous business flow

LINE COLOR & MATERIAL (2026 Gradient Mesh):
- The monoline does NOT use a flat single color. Instead, it uses a smooth path-following gradient:
  - Start (V): cool slate (#475569) — raw potential
  - First A: transitions to deep emerald (#065f46) — growth begins
  - Center bridge: bright emerald (#10b981) — peak energy
  - Second A: transitions to teal (#0d9488) — transformation
  - End (M): settles to deep navy (#0f172a) — delivered value
- This gradient flows along the actual path direction (not left-to-right), creating a natural energy-flow feeling
- The line has a subtle inner luminosity — a 0.5px white highlight runs along the top edge of the entire stroke at 15% opacity, giving a modern "lit tube" or "neon wire" effect without being garish

BELOW THE MONOLINE — WORDMARK:
- 24px below the monoline symbol, "VAAM" is typeset as a secondary wordmark
- Font: custom geometric sans-serif with variable weight — letters are slightly condensed (90% width), weight 500
- Letter-spacing: 0.5em (ultra-wide) — each letter stands independently like a column
- Between the two A's, a tiny diamond shape (◆) replaces the space — 4px, emerald green (#10b981) — referencing the photon dot and acting as a geometric accent
- This reads as "VA◆AM" and creates instant brand recognition
- Color: white (#f8fafc) on dark backgrounds, dark navy (#0f172a) on light

TAGLINE:
- "SOLAR ENERGY SOLUTIONS" in Inter, weight 300, letter-spacing 0.4em, all uppercase
- Size: 30% of wordmark cap-height
- Color: muted (#64748b on light, #64748b on dark — same slate gray for both)
- Positioned 16px below wordmark with NO separator line

DARK MODE FIRST PRESENTATION:
- Primary background: rich gradient surface — radial-gradient(ellipse at 30% 50%, #0f172a, #020617) — a subtle vignette effect
- The monoline glows softly against the dark canvas — a 24px gaussian blur of the line color at 8% opacity sits behind the stroke, creating an ambient energy aura
- The photon dot's glow is more visible and impactful on dark backgrounds — this is the HERO presentation

RESPONSIVE LOGO SYSTEM:
- Tier 1 — CINEMATIC (landing page hero, video intro): Full monoline + animated photon + wordmark + tagline, on dark gradient background
- Tier 2 — STANDARD (header, print): Static monoline + frozen photon + wordmark, no tagline
- Tier 3 — COMPACT (mobile, social avatar): Monoline symbol only (no wordmark), in a rounded-square dark container
- Tier 4 — MICRO (favicon): Just the photon dot — golden circle with green outer ring, 16×16px

3D SUBTLE DEPTH (2026 trend — NOT skeuomorphism):
- The monoline stroke has a barely perceptible 1px drop shadow (black at 5% opacity, 2px Y-offset, 4px blur) — just enough to lift it off the background plane
- The photon dot has a 2-layer depth: the glow layer sits BEHIND the line (as if illuminating from below), while the core dot sits ON TOP of the line
- This creates a sense of the energy traveling ON the wire, not just along it

COMPOSITION:
- Vertical lockup: monoline → gap → wordmark → gap → tagline — 1:1.8 aspect ratio
- The monoline symbol fits within a bounding box of approximately 5:2 (width:height)
- Minimum clear space: 1.5× monoline height on all sides
- Grid: 8px base unit

RENDERING:
- Show the main logo on the dark gradient background as the hero image
- Show a horizontal strip of the 4 responsive tiers
- Show a mockup: the animated monoline playing on a smartphone splash screen (dark mode)
- Show a mockup: logo embossed on a matte black premium packaging box for solar panel modules
- Show the photon animation as a 4-frame storyboard strip (photon at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% of path)
- Aesthetic: futuristic-yet-warm, tech-premium, energy-conscious, 2026 design-forward
- 4K resolution, vector-perfect, professional corporate identity
```

## 🔶 Prompt 3 — "Caspian Prism" (Xəzər Prizması — 2026 Glassmorphism + Geo-Identity)

```
Design a globally distinctive, 2026-trend-defining corporate logo for "VAAM" — a solar panel import-export trading and manufacturing company headquartered in Baku, Azerbaijan, operating across international markets. This logo must fuse Azerbaijani geographic/cultural identity with cutting-edge 2026 design aesthetics: glassmorphism, aurora gradients, 3D subtle depth, and responsive brand system architecture.

CONCEPT — CASPIAN PRISM:
A prism (triangular/diamond form) represents the core metaphor: just as a glass prism splits white sunlight into a spectrum of colors, VAAM takes raw solar energy and transforms it into a spectrum of valuable products and services. The prism shape also references: the "A" letterform in VAAM (triangular), Azerbaijan's "Land of Fire" identity (flame/prism), and the crystalline structure of silicon solar cells.

THE PRISM ICON (Primary Symbol):

Shape Construction:
- An equilateral triangle rotated to stand on one vertex (diamond-like orientation, pointing down) — this is the prism
- The triangle's proportions are 1:1.15 (width:height) — slightly taller than equilateral, creating an elegant, slender diamond that references the "A" in VAAM
- Inside the triangle, a single horizontal line crosses at 61.8% height from the bottom vertex (golden section), dividing the prism into an upper chamber and a lower chamber — this line is the "horizon" and also the crossbar of the hidden "A"

Light Ray System (the prism's magic):
- From the upper-left edge of the prism, a single white beam (2px, white at 80% opacity) enters the prism at a 30° downward angle
- Inside the upper chamber, this beam refracts and splits into 5 diverging rays that exit through the right edge of the prism
- These 5 exit rays use the brand's aurora gradient spectrum:
  Ray 1 (topmost): Deep emerald (#065f46)
  Ray 2: Emerald (#059669)
  Ray 3 (center): Bright green (#10b981)
  Ray 4: Teal (#0d9488)
  Ray 5 (bottommost): Warm amber (#f59e0b)
- Each ray is 1.5px width, with 3px gaps between them
- The rays extend 30% beyond the prism's right edge before fading out with a gradient-to-transparent
- This light-splitting creates the visual story: white sunlight → VAAM prism → spectrum of green energy products

Prism Surface Treatment (2026 Glassmorphism):
- The prism is NOT a flat shape — it has a glassmorphism treatment:
  - Fill: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255,255,255,0.12) 0%, rgba(255,255,255,0.05) 100%)
  - Border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.18) — a subtle frosted glass edge
  - Backdrop filter effect: a 12px blur (represented as a soft frosted area inside the prism shape)
  - A subtle internal highlight: a curved white line (0.5px, 20% opacity) near the top-left edge, simulating glass reflection
- The glassmorphism is designed for the DARK background presentation (primary) — on light backgrounds, the prism switches to a minimal outlined version (1.5px stroke, no fill)
- This glassmorphism approach is distinctly 2026 — evolved from 2022's heavy glass effects into something more refined and barely-there

Lower Chamber Detail:
- The lower triangular chamber (below the horizon line) contains a minimal solar cell grid: 3 thin lines (0.5px, white at 10% opacity) creating a subtle 2×2 grid pattern
- This references photovoltaic cell structure without being literal
- On the static version, the lower chamber has a barely perceptible emerald tint (rgba(16,185,129,0.04)) suggesting trapped green energy

THE WORDMARK:

"VAAM" Typography:
- Custom-designed geometric sans-serif, weight 600 (semibold)
- The "A" letters are the hero: their triangular form echoes the prism icon — the interior triangles of the A's (the counters) have the same 1:1.15 proportion as the prism
- The first "A" has a standard horizontal crossbar, but the second "A" has NO crossbar — instead, there's a small prism icon (the same icon, miniaturized to 6px) sitting inside the counter space where the crossbar would be — this is the signature detail that creates instant brand recognition
- Style: the letters use variable-width strokes — vertical strokes are 10% thicker than diagonal strokes, creating a refined, optically balanced modern feel
- Corner treatment: all outer corners are sharp (0px radius), all inner corners have 1px radius — this contrast creates a "precision-crafted" feeling

Color on Dark:
- Primary: white (#f1f5f9) letterforms — NOT pure white, slightly warm
- The mini-prism inside the second "A": uses the full glassmorphism treatment with the 5-ray spectrum visible at micro scale
- Alternative: the wordmark in emerald (#059669) for light backgrounds

Color on Light:
- Dark navy (#0f172a) letterforms
- The mini-prism inside A₂ uses a simplified version: thin outlined triangle with a single emerald line inside

TAGLINE — 2026 MINIMAL:
- "IMPORT · EXPORT · TRADING" — but redesigned for 2026:
  - Only "IMP · EXP · TRD" — abbreviated to three 3-letter blocks (the 2026 trend of hyper-abbreviation in corporate marks)
  - Font: Inter, weight 400, letter-spacing 0.6em, all uppercase
  - The centered dots (·) are replaced by tiny prism shapes (▽) at 3px — maintaining the prism motif at every scale
  - Color: slate (#94a3b8) on dark, (#64748b) on light
- Full tagline "IMPORT · EXPORT · TRADING" is available as a secondary option for formal documents

3D SUBTLE DEPTH (2026 Layered Design):
- The logo presentation has 3 perceived depth layers:
  Layer 1 (back): The 5 spectrum rays extend behind the prism, slightly blurred (2px)
  Layer 2 (mid): The glassmorphism prism sits at the focal plane
  Layer 3 (front): The white entry beam crosses over the prism edge, appearing to come FROM the viewer
- This layering creates a subtle parallax-like depth that is purely static but reads as dimensional
- On the wordmark, the mini-prism inside A₂ appears to float slightly above the letter plane (achieved via a 1px subtle shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0px X, 2px Y, 4px blur)

ANIMATION STATES (Motion-Ready):
- REVEAL: The white beam enters from the left, hits the prism (brief flash/pulse of the glassmorphism), then the 5 spectrum rays shoot out to the right one by one (100ms stagger) — total reveal: 1.2 seconds
- IDLE: The glass reflection highlight inside the prism slowly shifts position (60-second loop) — like real light catching glass at different angles
- INTERACTIVE: On hover, the spectrum rays intensify in brightness and extend 20% longer
- LOADING: The 5 spectrum rays pulse in sequence (wave pattern) — usable as a branded loading indicator

RESPONSIVE LOGO SYSTEM:
- Tier 1 — FULL: Prism icon (with rays) + VAAM wordmark + abbreviated tagline, on dark gradient background — for hero sections, splash screens, corporate presentations
- Tier 2 — STANDARD: Prism icon + VAAM wordmark — for headers, documents
- Tier 3 — COMPACT: Prism icon only — for social avatars, watermarks
- Tier 4 — MICRO: The prism shape filled with aurora gradient (no glassmorphism, no rays) — for 16×16 favicon and small contexts
- Tier 5 — WORDMARK ONLY: "VAAM" with the mini-prism in A₂ — for inline text and partner listings

CULTURAL LAYER (subtle, non-literal):
- The prism's triangular form subtly echoes the Flame Towers of Baku — Azerbaijan's most iconic architectural symbol
- The 5 spectrum rays reference the 5 main sectors VAAM operates across
- The overall composition (light entering from left, spectrum exiting right) mirrors the east-to-west direction of the Silk Road trade route — Azerbaijan's historical role as a bridge between East and West

BACKGROUND & PRESENTATION:
- HERO presentation: logo centered on a rich dark surface — background uses a subtle mesh gradient:
  radial-gradient(ellipse at 20% 60%, rgba(16,185,129,0.06) 0%, transparent 50%),
  radial-gradient(ellipse at 80% 30%, rgba(245,158,11,0.04) 0%, transparent 50%),
  linear-gradient(180deg, #020617 0%, #0f172a 100%)
  — this creates a very subtle aurora borealis effect behind the logo, referencing the energy theme
- Show the logo on a frosted glass business card mockup (premium, translucent card stock) with the prism printed in spot UV and the rays in holographic foil — a physical glassmorphism effect
- Show the logo as a loading animation storyboard (6 frames)
- Show all 5 responsive tiers in a progressive reduction strip
- Show the prism icon as a pattern: 12 prisms arranged in a 3×4 grid with varying rotation angles, used as a brand pattern for packaging or backgrounds
- 2026 design aesthetic: refined glassmorphism, aurora gradients, cultural depth, motion-native, responsive-first
- 4K resolution, vector-perfect, professional corporate brand identity system
```
